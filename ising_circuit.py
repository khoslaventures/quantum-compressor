"""Demonstrates a compressed simulation of the transverse field 1D-Ising
Interaction. This is an example of compressed quantum computation simulating
the Ising chain of n qubits by using only log(n) qubits.

Compressed quantum simulation of the transverse field Ising model has already
been realized in an experiment using NMR quantum computing. Here, we also
simulate this model with open boundary conditions, whose evolution is governed
by the Hamiltonian:

         n          n-1
H(J) =   Σ  Z_k + J  Σ   X_k X_k+1
        k=1         k=1

Where X_k (Z_k) denote X (Z) acting on qubit k, respectively. In the limit
n->infinity, the system undergoes a quantum phase transition at J=1 that is
reflected in the discontinuity of the second derivative of the transverse
magnetization.

M(J), the magnetization can be measured by:
1. Initially prepare the system in the ground state of H(0)
2. Evolve the system to the ground state of H(J) by changing the parameter J
   adiabatically
3. Apply Z on a single qubit and measure to obtain the transverse magnetization
   M(J)

As this adiabatic evolution together with the measurement of the magnetization
is a matchgate circuit, the whole computation can be compressed into a
universal quantum computation running on only m = log(n) qubits.

        For L = 2000 and T = 100, the circuit should produce very accurate
        values.  However, it makes for very slow runtimes, so we've been using
        L = 200 and T = 10 which Kraus claimed to produce decent enough
        results.
